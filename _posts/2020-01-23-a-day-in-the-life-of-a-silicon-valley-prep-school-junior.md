Last Thursday I shadowed one of my students for the day. Now, before I proceed, I must admit: I didn't quite achieve the full experience. I didn't complete a full night of homework the evening before, which is perhaps my greatest deviation from my students' experiences. If I had spent a few hours the evening before working on different assignments for different classes, I may have a greater appreciation for what my students go through. But, of course, that may be another question for another day.

Now: I shadowed Ashley, a junior in my C-block precalculus class. Ashley may not be a typical case, but her schedule aligned with mine perfectly: I wanted to shadow on a day I was offering a quiz (so I could miss F-block with minimal consequences), and I wanted to oberve a junior on a day they had bio and english (the two courses every junior takes). I sent this request to all of my students the day before break began, and Ashley was one of the students who volunteered. Part of the shadowing I think I executed perfectly: I saw the right classes, and I didn't force a student into the responsibility of schlepping me around all day. Instead, Ashley opted into it, and since it was her choice, I think she felt more comfortable answering random questions about her schedule and studies from her math teacher.

Here's what I made of the day:
1. Menlo teachers are excellent, and these kids are lucky to have them

I only saw two other teachers, so perhaps lumping together all Menlo teachers into this group is a presumptuous fantasy; that said, the two I saw blew me away. Ashley's schedule for the four block day is as follows:

2. It's torture to sit for seventy minutes (and, luckily, I didn't have to)

3. The 20-minute rule is crucial and ought to be observed
