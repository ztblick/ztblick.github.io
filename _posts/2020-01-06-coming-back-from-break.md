I sleep poorly once,  
maybe twice a year. Why is  
it always last night?

I remember talking with Sue about this. She felt it was important to understand how I felt the night before. *What is it about transitions that unsettles you, Zach?* she asked. I remember sitting in her office. It was January in Evanston, a sorry sight indeed. The window looked out into a world in grey and white: snow and pavement and a grey-white sky growing dimmer as the too-soon evening closed in.

*I think transitions unsettle me...becuase they have power over me? Because I never feel like I'm ready for them?* That sure does make sense. But is anyone ever ready? No. Does that help? Not really. But perhaps it does reframe the question: why should I feel that I need to be ready? Is it possible to feel motivation to prepare without inadequacy with the level of preparation?

Today, I must remember to lead with love. I am happy, genuinely, to see my students. It is nice to be back in a routine. I am grateful for my smart colleagues and my beautiful school. Teaching, while challenging, is a privilege and a joy. Let that joy shine.
