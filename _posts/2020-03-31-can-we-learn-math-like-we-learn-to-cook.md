It's Day 20 of social distancing, and that means cooking. More cooking than ever before.

To be honest, cooking has been the best part of the quarantine. I've found myself less hesitant in the kitchen. I don't think it has much to do with the pandemic itself â€” I'd say my growing confidence in the kitchen has been building all year.

This morning illustrates a nice example, though. I made a breakfast quesadilla. I was inspired by Kenji Lopez-Alt, whose breakfast quesadilla [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dw2UyqIaik) drew drool out of my mouth and onto my pillow (really, I shouldn't watch cooking videos on YouTube right before bed...or maybe I should).

The best part was my fearlessness: once I had a roadmap for the dish in my head, all I had to do was execute. The bacon led swiftly into the egg-cracking, the beating, the transition from bacon-pan to egg-pan, the death-defying whirl of the pan upside down to transfer the tortilla from top to bottom (I felt vaguely like Alex Honnold,  boulder-probleming my breakfast).

It may be trite, but it's true: I felt empowered making breakfast this morning. And I felt damn proud of the result. The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the bacon added the right amount of salt. I even got a cheese-stretch as I pulled away my first slice (how could it get better?).

What if school made us feel like this? What if students left a math class feeling like they just stretched their own cheese? I want to give students the opportunity to step away from a project and feel like they created their own breakfast quesadillas, math-style. To accomplish this, though, I wonder: what has to be added, and what has to be removed?

For example: I did not worry about messing up my breakfast. Firstly, we had cereal in the cupboard. I'm more than okay with Honey Bunches of Oats. But, on top of that, I knew it didn't matter: if I messed up the quesadilla, I'd learn something. And I could try again tomorrow morning. If students are to learn in this creative way, they must feel empowered to fail.

I also did it on my own accord: I saw Kenji's video. I liked it. I made the plan. I decided that I wanted to cook&mdash;and to improve my cooking&mdash;in the first place. All of this came from within. Put it simply: I was hungry.

And, so, it comes down to motivation and empowerment. I wanted to cook, I wasn't afraid to cook, I had all the implements I needed, I watched a mentor cook first, and I knew I would eat no matter what.

"Anyone can cook," says Gusteau, which Ego reiterates: "A great chef can come from anywhere." If I am to believe that any of my students can become a great thinker&mdash;a person who lives for the sake of the community, who dedicates their heart to the great problems of the world&mdash;then I ought to provide them with what they need. I need to whet their appetite, to serve them up examples, to show them kitchen basics...then challenge them to make themselves breakfast.
