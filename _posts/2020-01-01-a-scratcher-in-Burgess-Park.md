I found a scratcher in Burgess Park
Black Lucky Horse: "Match three and win!"

Eight Days Before, Dad gave us three:
for me, a Christmas Tree
with prizes hidden beneath its leaves.

Who buys these scratchers?
The folks who get lottery tickets, I've been told,
Are dumb: "A tax on people who don't understand math,"
read a sticker on the door to my classroom
Left behind by someone (an old teacher, perhaps).

To be desperate, that's the precondition
For spending just a dollar
To feel that's the only way, the only unlikely thing
To break you out of the dept, the spiral of things
You cannot afford.

My father lost a house;
Who else would play when the house always wins?

When I moved into my classroom in August,
I peeled the sticker off the door
It came apart as I tore it away, and cast it in the trash
Just as I cast away the scratcher I found in Burgess Park.
