I found a scratcher in Burgess Park:  
Black Lucky Horse â€” "Match three and win!"  
Eight Days Before, Dad gave us three:  
For me, a Christmas Tree with gifts  
hidden beneath its leaves.

Who buys a scratcher? I thought,  
turning the ticket over in my hands.  
The folks who play the lotto, I've been told,  
are dumb: "A tax on people who don't understand math,"  
read a sticker on the door to my classroom,  
left behind by an old teacher, I presume.

What's the precondition  
for spending just a dollar?  
To feel that breaking out of debt
cannot be done without the chance?  
My father lost a house;  
who else would play  
when the house always wins?  

When I moved into my classroom in August,  
I peeled the sticker off the door  
It came apart as I tore it away.  
I cast it in the trash just as I cast away  
the scratcher I found in Burgess Park.
