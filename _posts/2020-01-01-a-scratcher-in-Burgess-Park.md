I found a scratcher in Burgess Park:  
Black Lucky Horse â€” "Match three and WIN!"  
Eight days before, Dad gave us three:  
for me, a Christmas Tree with gifts  
hidden beneath its leaves.

Who buys a scratcher? I thought,  
turning the ticket over in my hands.  
The folks who play the lotto, I've been told,  
are dumb: "A tax on people who don't understand math,"  
read a sticker on the door to my classroom,  
left behind by an old teacher, I presume.

Where do you feel the urge to spend that dollar?  
Does it rest in the gut, a sour-turning twist,  
Like a penny swallowed and forgotten?  
Does it rest in the head, sending messages  
saying, "We cannot afford not to try  
We can only afford the chance?"

My father lost a house;  
who else would play  
when the house always wins?

When I moved into my classroom in August,  
I peeled the sticker off the door  
It came apart as I tore it away.  
I cast it in the trash just as I cast away  
the scratcher I found in Burgess Park.
