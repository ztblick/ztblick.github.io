Yes! This site is coming together, and I couldn't be more excited. ZTBlick is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
and github pages. Learning curve is a bit tricky, but I'm finding [jmcglone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages)
to be incredibly helpful. Can't wait to finally start bringing my ideas to life!
