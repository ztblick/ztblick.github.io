Last night I had dinner with Ari (of course, it's a Saturday) and Paul, his soon-to-be brother-in-law (enough dashes for ya?). Paul, Ari, and I together represent a nice triangle of relationships: Paul and Ari are essentially family, Ari and I are best friends, Paul and I are both educators. It's a cool interconnected, complete K3 graph (which, by the way, is the snootiest graph-theoretic way of saying "trianle").

At some point over our family-style Thai meal (yellow curry, avocado spring rolls, thai salad of Paul's requested "medium spice," much to my face-melting disappoinment), the conversation turned away from Paul. Ari asked me how my renegotiation endeavors were going, and I said I'd crunched the numbers (I had) and had realized that I would be asking for a raise in the neightborhood of $10k. After explaining myself, Ari asked Paul (who is a head of a charter school in Wilmington) if he would give me the raise.

"I would absolutely give you a $10,000 raise," said Paul, without hesitation. I grinned at how clear it was to him. He continued: "Especially since you're entering your fourth year: teachers in their fourth and fifth years are by far the most valuable to your school."

I was shocked. Paul said a well-known, well-respected study claimed just as much (which led, of course, to jibes at the replication crisis and social science in general from all three of us). Still, Paul argued something that I find hopeful and exciting: that in the fourth and fifth years, teachers really start to hit their stride.

(now, I'll continue following this exciting note while also ignoring the fact that Paul also said that teachers generally plateau after this point â€” and often begin to get worse not long after.)

So, here's the first question: whose study? A cursory google search leads me to...
