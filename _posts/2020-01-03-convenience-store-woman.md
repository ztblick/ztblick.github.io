I read Sayaka Murata's *Convenience Store Woman* in a twelve-hour span. It seems the book, just TKTK small pages, gets rolling and never stops. Like its protagonist, Keiko Furukura, the novel spins along like a cog in the machine. “I am one of those cogs, going round and round,” the conveninece store worker describes. “I have become a functioning part of the world, rotating in the time of day called morning.”

What is it about this book that affected me? In part, it must be its description of a young human playing her role in a late-capitalist society. Keiko is desribed to have no identity, no sense of self. There is no inherent passion within Keiko; instead, she cannibalizes others to form her patchwork personality. She speaks by borrowing the phrases of her co-workers, Suguwaru and Ms. TKTKTK. Keiko dresses like Ms. TKTK as well, going so far as to check her co-worker's clothing for brands and labels.

This behavior – this drifting, listless grabbing at others' outward selves — it sticks with me. There's something relatable to it that I have felt. At 25, living in the Bay Area, I find myself surrounded by tech and finance and poverty and climate change and problems spiraling at an exponential rate. I walk around, and I feel hopeless at times. I see trees, and I think about mass extinctions. I see people living behind the bathroom at Burgess Park, and I think about capitalism. The problems seem intractable, and I feel powerless to help. Then I begin to criticise myself for doing so little. *Why don't you give up your own comfort?* I ask myself. *If you were truly a good person, wouldn't you do more?*

Well, perhaps this is the beginning of doing more: in writing my thoughts out more clearly, they take greater form. The process of writing helps me find myself. And in documenting it, perhaps I will hold myself accountable to my values. And, ideally, it will allow me to learn more from the process, too. After all, living a life I approve of is an iterative process.

Keiko at once finds herself and doesn't. It's strange: in becoming a convenience store worker, she becomes a new person. She refers to this as her *rebirth.* This leads to a humorous observation on her part: once she has worked at the convenience store for eighteen years, she notes that her "convenience store-self is eighteen years old." This is an adult — or, in the legal sense, a full person.

While this new Keiko has an identity and a sense of purpose, the original Keiko does not. That Keiko, it seems, disappears. That bothers me. As a millennial, perhaps it is bound to bother me. I cannot get it out of my mind that most millennials crave, above all else, authenticity.

*Authenticity.* When I think of those who I admire, I bring to mind those whose authenticity shines the brightest. They never seem to care what others thought. They follow themselves. They are self-confident. I hope to build up this confidence. I want to be more like those people.

Yet, if I think more like Keiko, I wonder: my critique of Keiko stems from her copycatting. By stealing the mannerisms and styles of her co-workers, Keiko recontructs herself to be a convenience store worker (and, at times, "normal"). I critique this for its inauthenticity. Yet, I cannot shake the fact that my desire for authenticity must come from an inauthentic place. Specifically, I feel this way because I have been made to feel this way. And that's a sticky situation.

Ultimately, though, I give it a pass, and it's for a couple reasons. First, it seems to fall within the rule of recursive exception, so I'll let it go. And, secondly, if I really get to the bottom of it, my desire for authenticity is something entirely out of my control, because everything in my life has been inherited. I most always remember that I did not ask to be born, nor did I choose where and when. Thus, I am no better nor worse than Keiko. Perhaps, then, she would appreciate me and my perspective: could I have looked down on her for not marrying or having children? For not having a real job? I hope not. But, then again, I wasn't born into her world.
