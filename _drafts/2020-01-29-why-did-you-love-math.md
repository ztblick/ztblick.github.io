In the spirit of Parker J. Palmer's *The Courage to Teach*, I find myself wondering: What did I love about math as a student? Why is it that, since I can remember, math puzzles and problem-solving held a special place in my head and my heart? What was it about the subject—and myself—that forged such a connection?

As a third-year teacher, I ride the rollercoaster through the highest highs and the lowest lows.

> We did not mearly find a sibject to teach—the subject also found us. We may recover the heart to teach by remembering how that sbuject evoked a sense of self that was only dormant in us before we encountered the subject's way of naming and framing life.

Nice, right? This initial love, this first love, has been on my mind of late. It started with exponentials. Upon returning from winter break, I challenged my students to begin to wrap their heads around this fundamental, yet unintuitive mathematical relationship. It surprises me how difficult it can be for a 16-year-old to wrap their head around an exponential function. For some reason, taking a number and *multiplying* continuously is so much harder for them to understand than *adding*.

But, in teaching this, I found myself flashing back to my first experience with exponentials. I remember sitting in a living room—was I on the floor?—and reading about the following scenario:
