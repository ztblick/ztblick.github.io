In the spirit of Parker J. Palmer's *The Courage to Teach*, I find myself wondering: What did I love about math as a student? Why is it that, since I can remember, math puzzles and problem-solving has held a special place in my head and my heart? 

> We did not mearly find a sibject to teachâ€”the subject also found us. We may recover the heart to teach by remembering how that sbuject evoked a sense of self that was only dormant in us before we encountered the subject's way of naming and framing life.

Nice, right?
