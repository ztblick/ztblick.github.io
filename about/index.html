	<h1>More about me? Gosh, I'm flattered...</h1>
	<p>Yale '16+1 is the elitist way of saying I took off a year to sing with the Whiffenpoofs, which is the elitist way of saying I
	delayed my life for a year to sing and travel on someone else's dime. Now who's gonna say no to that? I never traveled as a kid,
	so I'll take every opportunity I can get while I'm still an Eli. Crazy crazy times. I'll try to take pictures.</p>
