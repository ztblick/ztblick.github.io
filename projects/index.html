	<h1>The Works</h1>
	<p>I dedicated the 2017 and 2018 academic years to the Penn Day School Teaching Residency. I designed and implemented math curricula while reading and writing about history, philosophy, and pedagogy. During my second year, I compiled my work into a portfolio[LINK].</p>
	
	<p>During the fall of my senior at Yale, I proved[LINK] the computational complexity of a problem postulated by my advisor, Dan Spielman. I presented[LINK] my findings to my residential college that November.</p>

	<p>While at Yale, I sang with the Whiffenpoofs, the Alley Cats, and the Yale Glee Club.</p>

	<p>I take pictures[LINK], compose vocal music[LINK], and sing[LINK].</p>

	<p>Sometimes, I write[LINK].</p>
