	<h1>The Works</h1>
	<p>I dedicated the 2017 and 2018 academic years to the Penn Day School Teaching Residency. I designed and implemented math curricula while reading and writing about history, philosophy, and pedagogy. During my second year, I compiled my work into a <a href="https://ztblick.weebly.com/">portfolio</a>.</p>
	
	<p>During the fall of my senior at Yale, I <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uj6ChnW1rpdAIktXHDf0qBZO50eGtg0u/view?usp=sharing">proved</a> the computational complexity of a problem postulated by my advisor, Dan Spielman. I <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B31nKZetF2SAblMwVERSaTh6VzA/view">presented</a> my findings to my residential college that November.</p>

	<p>While at Yale, I sang with the Whiffenpoofs, the Alley Cats, and the Yale Glee Club.</p>

	<p>I take pictures, compose vocal music, and sing.</p>

	<p>Sometimes, I <a href="https://ztblick.github.io/blog">write</a>.</p>
