		<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Zach</p>
		<p>I'm a teacher, researcher, and writer. I design and teach classes at Menlo School, focusing on authentic assessment in community-driven classrooms. I strive to give students collaborative, equitable experiences that grow minds and shape souls. I post periodic ponderings, from puzzles to poems, which you can find <a href="../blog">here<a/> </p>
