		<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Zach!</p>
		<p>Math teacher by day, amateur philosopher by night. I majored in computer science at Yale, graduating in 2017, followed by two years in the Independent School Residency at UPenn. I'm passionate about data and decency, and I'm hoping to pursue a career in soul-shaping. In the meantime, I'm hard at work creating new STEM curricula, advocating for electoral reform, singing choral music, and keeping up with those I love.</p>
